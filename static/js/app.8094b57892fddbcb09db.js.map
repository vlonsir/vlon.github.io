mPaaS 平台，让大家也可以去接触使用到支付宝的 Hybrid 技术。</p>\r\n\t\t\t<h3 id=\"articleHeader0\">移动互联网背景下的高可用性能挑战</h3>\r\n\t\t\t<p>根据公开的 2018 年移动互联网行业分析报告，目前支付宝的月活跃用户已经超过 QQ ，成为国内第二大 App。</p>\r\n\t\t\t<p><span class=\"img-wrap\"><img referrerpolicy=\"no-referrer\" data-src=\"/img/bVbwBV7?w=616&amp;h=238\" src=\"/img/bVbwBV7?w=616&amp;h=238\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" style=\"cursor: pointer; display: inline;\"></span></p>\r\n\t\t\t<p>支付宝一开始仅仅只是一个单体应用的工具型 App，让用户可以在手机完成支付宝相关的业务查询和操作。2013 年后，支付宝逐步转型为平台型 App， 平台型 App 具有服务化、模块化、工具组件化的特点，这个时候支付宝的业务不仅仅是支付，还需要给客户提供了很多生活相关的服务，例如余额宝、缴电费等。2015 年后支付宝成长为超级 App，超级 App 会面临开放、动态化、高可用的挑战，此时支付宝里面需要支持大量复杂的业务，同时开放自己的商业能力，用自己流量助力合作伙伴。<br>从单体应用到超级 App 的转变，其实体现了一个用户对 App 需求的变化，移动互联网用户需求的本质是服务，而不是 App，用户高频使用的 App 是少数。在 超级 App 时代，支付宝主要面临的挑战是：</p>\r\n\t\t\t<p>1、<strong>支持复杂业务</strong></p>\r\n\t\t\t<p>App 的业务越来越复杂，不仅仅是内部业务，还包含了大量外部的合作伙伴。如果采用传统的 App 开发方式很难应对日趋复杂的业务场景。</p>\r\n\t\t\t<p>2、<strong>满足业务快速迭代的需求</strong></p>\r\n\t\t\t<p>当前业务的另外一个特点就是需要快速迭代，变化的政策、突发事件都需要我们可以快速把新的业务需求触达给用户。但是 App 开发一个不容忽视的问题，就是应用商店审核。由于审核的存在，App 上开发的业务会有一个统一排期，比如说月底会有新版本，那么所有的业务进度都得考虑 App 的排期计划。</p>\r\n\t\t\t<p>3、<strong>开放平台</strong></p>\r\n\t\t\t<p>作为超级 App，一个最主要的特征就是开放。开放就是共享 App 的流量，让外部伙伴的业务可以通过支付宝触达用户，这就面临一个质量管控的问题。支付宝需要保证这些业务是合法合规的，保障用户的财产安全。</p>\r\n\t\t\t<p>在超级 App 时代，使用纯 Native 开发会遇到很大的局限性。这里纯 Native 开发指的是，iOS 使用 Objective-C 或者 Swift 开发、Android 使用 Java 或者 Kotlin开发。纯 Native 开发，业务逻辑的变化都需要通过发布新版本来触达用户，所以会面临前面提到的发布审核周期长的问题。另一方面，用户每次需要使用新功能，都需要更新一次 App ，这对用户来说是一个成本很高的问题，会导致新业务很难在短时间覆盖用户。</p>\r\n\t\t\t<p>站在开发的角度，纯 Native 的开发效率会比前端低很多，而且同时需要 iOS 和 Android 的开发人员。包大小也是需要考虑的问题，如果目前支付宝的业务都是用 Native 开发，大家看到的包大小得增加好几倍，这进一步增加了用户的升级成本。作为开放平台，Native 代码的权限和版本管理会变得异常的复杂，每次发版本就都需要同时协调内部和外部伙伴的业务，事情就变得非常糟糕了。</p>\r\n\t\t\t<p>所以，现在 App 开发肯定离不开 Hybrid 方案，Hybrid 方案就是混合开发，同时结合了 Native 开发和 Web 开发技术。Web 开发经过 20 年的发展，已经将 结构 HTML、表现 CSS 和 行为 JS 3 部分拆开，因此具有很高的开发效率。Hybrid 方案同时具有跨平台的特征，一份代码同时发布到 iOS 和 Android，节省开发时间。基于 Hybrid 方案开发的业务可以快速发布，而不用考虑 APP 发版实践，给业务很大的灵活性。相比于 Web 开发，Hybrid 方案提供了丰富的设备 API，让更多业务形态成为可能。</p>\r\n\t\t\t<h3 id=\"articleHeader1\">支付宝 Hybrid 方案建设与演进</h3>\r\n\t\t\t<p>目前支付宝有 2 套 Hybrid 方案：&nbsp;<strong>HTML5 容器</strong>与<strong>小程序</strong>。小程序是最近几年才出来，H5 容器已经有了很长时间的历史，所以我们就先从 H5 容器说起。</p>\r\n\t\t\t<ul><li><strong>H5 容器</strong></li></ul>\r\n\t\t\t<p>在支付宝中，HTML5 容器架构如图所示：</p>\r\n\t\t\t<p><span class=\"img-wrap\"><img referrerpolicy=\"no-referrer\" data-src=\"/img/bVbwBV9?w=1280&amp;h=884\" src=\"/img/bVbwBV9?w=1280&amp;h=884\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" style=\"cursor: pointer; display: inline;\"></span></p>\r\n\t\t\t<p>最上层是浏览器，这块就是大家常见的 Web 开发环境，包括 HTML、CSS、JavaScript等。H5 容器作为中间层，将浏览器和支付宝底层框架有机结合起来，在 H5 容器里面有 2 个非常重要的概念： JSBridge 和 离线包，后面会做详细介绍。支付宝底层框架会给 H5 容器提供 Native 的能力，这其中就包括 RPC（远程过程调用，用来实现 APP 和服务器通信）、支付、扫一扫等。</p>\r\n\t\t\t<ul><li><strong>JSBridge</strong></li></ul>\r\n\t\t\t<p>JSBridge 是 H5 容器的基石，桥接了 JS 环境与 Native，实现了 Native 代码和 浏览器 环境的双向通信，Native 代码可以通过调用 浏览器 提供的接口运行JS，从而实现调用 JS 函数、传递参数到 JS 环境等；而浏览器到JS环境的通信是通过 Native 拦截浏览器的请求来实现，请求可以是网络请求或者是一些内部函数的调用。<br><span class=\"img-wrap\"><img referrerpolicy=\"no-referrer\" data-src=\"/img/bVbwBWb?w=1424&amp;h=726\" src=\"/img/bVbwBWb?w=1424&amp;h=726\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" style=\"cursor: pointer; display: inline;\"></span></p>\r\n\t\t\t<p>那么 JSBridge 会带来什么好处呢，在传统的 Web 开发场景，H5 页面会通过 HTTP 的 GET 或者 POST 请求到后台获取数据，就会用到 jQuery 等 AJAX 框架。但是 H5 页面中的 JS 函数公开的，没法做一些加密逻辑，同时对于无法优化网络。这几年随着 4G 和流量卡的普及，让手机网络变得更快、更便宜，在这之前大量用户会面临流量不足、信号差、网络不稳定的情况，这些场景在现在依然存在，而纯 Web 方案是没法提供相关的优化。</p>\r\n\t\t\t<p><span class=\"img-wrap\"><img referrerpolicy=\"no-referrer\" data-src=\"/img/bVbwBWc?w=1430&amp;h=828\" src=\"/img/bVbwBWc?w=1430&amp;h=828\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" style=\"cursor: pointer; display: inline;\"></span></p>\r\n\t\t\t<p>H5 容器提供的 JSBridge 解决了这个问题，所有 H5 页面需要从后台获取的数据都通过 JS Bridge 调用 Native 的 RPC SDK 来获取。这样实际 App 请求的数据都是由 RPC SDK 来发送，从而可以实现安全加密、签名校验、弱网优化、流量优化的功能。Native 层的这些功能是 Web 页面开发人员无感知的，所以业务开发人员只需要专注其自身的业务开发即可。安全性由支付宝底层 SDK 保障。</p>\r\n\t\t\t<p><span class=\"img-wrap\"><img referrerpolicy=\"no-referrer\" data-src=\"/img/bVbwBWd?w=1430&amp;h=780\" src=\"/img/bVbwBWd?w=1430&amp;h=780\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" style=\"cursor: pointer; display: inline;\"></span></p>\r\n\t\t\t<p>H5 容器提供了 2 种扩展方式：<br><strong>1. JSAPI</strong><br>JSAPI 方式给 H5 页面增加了 Native 功能调用接口，通过实现自定义 JSAPI 类中的 handler 方式，可以以 Native 的形式实现特定功能，例如调用 Native 加密函数。</p>\r\n\t\t\t<p><strong>2. 事件</strong><br>H5 容器在状态变化时会发送事件，通过监听 H5 容器特定事件，可以实现对 H5 容器生命周期的处理，比如修改加载进度条颜色、修改页面导航栏等。事件提供了更强的定制性，完全可以满足对 H5 容器的各种自定义需求。</p>\r\n\t\t\t<ul><li><strong>H5 容器离线包</strong></li></ul>\r\n\t\t\t<p>H5 容器离线包是 H5 容器用户体验的关键。<br>在 APP 里面打开一个线上页面的时候，通常会有一个白屏的阶段，这是浏览器需要从服务器下载 HTML 资源。由于手机网络的限制，这个时间会很不确定，通常会花费 300ms 以上的时间，用户在这个时间里面就会看到页面白屏。</p>\r\n\t\t\t<p><span class=\"img-wrap\"><img referrerpolicy=\"no-referrer\" data-src=\"/img/bVbwBWg?w=1548&amp;h=776\" src=\"/img/bVbwBWg?w=1548&amp;h=776\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" style=\"cursor: pointer; display: inline;\"></span></p>\r\n\t\t\t<p>为了优化 H5 容器用户体验，减少白屏时间，支付宝在 H5 容器中引入了离线包技术。离线包可以简单理解为一个 zip 压缩包，其中包含前端页面所需的 HTML、CSS、JS、图片等资源。内置到客户端后，H5 容器打开离线包页面时会直接从离线包中获取资源，这个是毫秒的访问时间，消除了打开页面白屏现象。</p>\r\n\t\t\t<p>在支付宝中，离线包分为 2 种：<strong>普通的业务资源包</strong>和<strong>公共资源包</strong>。先说公共资源包吧，公共资源包中会包含一些框架 JS、CSS、常见图片等，这些资源在整个 App 里面就只保存一份；而业务资源包中只保存该业务所需的页面静态资源，业务之间是相互独立解耦的。这样一个业务的页面资源就会同时来自其业务资源包和公共资源包，公共资源包的存在优化了 App 大小。</p>\r\n\t\t\t<p><span class=\"img-wrap\"><img referrerpolicy=\"no-referrer\" data-src=\"/img/bVbwBWj?w=1630&amp;h=688\" src=\"/img/bVbwBWj?w=1630&amp;h=688\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" style=\"cursor: pointer; display: inline;\"></span></p>\r\n\t\t\t<p>为了满足快速发布的需求，H5 容器离线包提供了更新机制，以单个离线包作为更新维度。因为单个离线包业务很简单，所以离线包的大小是可控的，通常小于 500KB，这样单个离线包的更新时间可控，可以做到用户无感知。在一些极端网络场景下，新的业务资源包没有更新超过，而我们又期望用户使用的是最新的业务，这个时候 fallback 访问机制就会发挥作用。每个离线包资源都会在服务器存放一份，在刚刚说到的极端场景下，用户会访问服务器的 fallback 地址获取资源，从而保障页面可用。</p>\r\n\t\t\t<p><span class=\"img-wrap\"><img referrerpolicy=\"no-referrer\" data-src=\"/img/bVbwBWk?w=1764&amp;h=932\" src=\"/img/bVbwBWk?w=1764&amp;h=932\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" style=\"cursor: pointer; display: inline;\"></span></p>\r\n\t\t\t<p>结合前面说到的离线包后，整个 H5 容器渲染流程如下。其中离线包资源的更新、下载对用户无感知，页面访问的资源是来自离线包还是来自 fallback 地址对前端是无感知的。</p>\r\n\t\t\t<p><span class=\"img-wrap\"><img referrerpolicy=\"no-referrer\" data-src=\"/img/bVbwBWp?w=1848&amp;h=1006\" src=\"/img/bVbwBWp?w=1848&amp;h=1006\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" style=\"cursor: pointer; display: inline;\"></span></p>\r\n\t\t\t<ul><li><strong>UC Webview 内核</strong></li></ul>\r\n\t\t\t<p>为了提高 H5 容器稳定性，支付宝在安卓系统上使用了 UC Webview，UC Webview 的崩溃率和ANR率远低于系统浏览器，而且彻底规避了安卓系统 Webview 碎片化问题，相信做过安卓前端页面兼容的同学一定可以体会到使用一个浏览器内核的好处。</p>\r\n\t\t\t<p><span class=\"img-wrap\"><img referrerpolicy=\"no-referrer\" data-src=\"/img/bVbwBWq?w=1664&amp;h=898\" src=\"/img/bVbwBWq?w=1664&amp;h=898\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" style=\"cursor: pointer; display: inline;\"></span></p>\r\n\t\t\t<p>H5 容器作为一个成熟的 Hybrid 方案可以满足大部分的业务场景需求，但是其依然存在一些局限性。H5 容器的业务开发部分还保持着前端开发思维，毕竟整个过程都是使用的前端技术，只需要在业务开发完成后集成到 APP 中完成测试。但是客户端开发其中还有很多关键的概念，例如 iOS 的 ViewController 、Android 的 Activity 等，对客户端页面栈有清楚的了解更有助于开发 H5 容器。同时 H5 容器还存在一个致命的问题就是无法管控质量，宽泛的前端规范让管控变得异常困难。</p>\r\n\t\t\t<ul><li><strong>支付宝小程序</strong></li></ul>\r\n\t\t\t<p>为了解决 H5 容器的局限性，顺应当前 APP 共享开放的需求，支付宝推出了新的 Hybrid 方案：支付宝小程序。支付宝小程序一种全新的开放模式，它运行在支付宝客户端，可以被便捷地获取和传播，为终端用户提供更优的用户体验 。支付宝小程序基于 Web 技术，因此学习成本低；其一套代码同时支持 iOS 和 Android；并提供了丰富组件和 API；完全为 APP 开发而生。目前支付宝小程序已经提供 2000 多个开放接口，API 日调用次数超过 25 亿次，拥有超过 100 万的合作伙伴和超过 10 万个活跃服务商。</p>\r\n\t\t\t<p>支付宝小程序同时还支持了阿里系多个 App ，包括口碑、高德和钉钉。<br>那么支付宝小程序是怎么解决 H5 容器的局限性呢？首先支付宝小程序是基于一个定制的 DSL 语言，不是前端的标准，但是类似。在 DSL 规则下业务进行小程序的开发，不支持直接操作 DOM，这种 DSL 规则下的自由可以有效的进行质量管控。另外支付宝小程序可以提供比 H5 小程序更优秀的性能、体验和兼容性，可以无感替换底层框架，应对遇到的性能问题。<br>目前支付宝小程序也支持前面提到的 H5 容器所使用的离线包技术，同时也支持 JSAPI 和事件的扩展方式，提供了更大的灵活性。</p>\r\n\t\t\t<p><span class=\"img-wrap\"><img

容器和小程序已经经过实际严苛的业务考验，通过前面的介绍相信大家已经有了了解。</p>\r\n\t\t\t<p>从 0 开始开发一套 Hybrid 框架需要大量的人力以及反复的业务验证，对于大部分公司来说成本太高。而使用开源的 Hybrid 框架，例如 Cordova、Weex、React Native、Flutter等会面临一个非常致命的问题，就是遇到框架层的问题，很难获得及时有效的技术支持。</p>\r\n\t\t\t<p>目前支付宝的 Hybrid 方案已经借助移动开发平台 mPaaS 对外输出，解决前面提到的痛点，让你直接和支付宝使用同一套框架层代码，而且提供及时的技术支持。</p>\r\n\t\t\t<p>mPaaS 是一站式移动开发解决方案，提供了移动开发所需的 5 大组件：MGS、MDS、MPS、MAS、MSS，这些组件都是基于支付宝，经过实际业务考验。</p>\r\n\t\t\t<p>其中 mPaaS 的 Hybrid 解决方案就包含前面提到：<strong>H5 容器</strong>、<strong>离线包</strong>、<strong>小程序</strong>&nbsp;三大部分。</p>\r\n\t\t\t<p>mPaaS H5
